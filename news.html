            <h2>Khairy visited flood victims in the field.</h2>
            <p>Kuala Lumpur: Yesterday's floods at Taman Setia Warisan, Kampung Melayu Subang, Selangor, drew the attention of Sungai Buloh parliamentary candidate Khairy Jamaluddin, who came to the pitch to listen to residents' complaints. Khairy also offered to send a crew to clean the homes of the locals after the floodwaters receded. "So we'll work on it, and the Department of Irrigation and Drainage (JPS) has also recommended raising the wall or extending the tyre that's been built to the bottom so that the water doesn't overflow." "I hope everyone here is patient," he remarked.</p>
